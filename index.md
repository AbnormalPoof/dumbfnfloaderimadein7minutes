## What is Kade Engine?

Kade Engine is an engine rework of the OG games engine. Simply put, we give you some great new features while also giving you the latest GitHub features.

## Features

The features that Kade Engine implements are:
- New Input System

*Hate the old engine because your inputs are delayed? Are inputs being dropped? Well with this input system, inputs rarely get dropped! If you wanna see an example of what it feels like, play any 4k rhythm game like Quaver or Etterna!*

- Accuracy Mod

*We've modified the accuracy mod to create an amazing accuracy display, which shows your accuracy and misses. While giving you a basic ranking on how you are currently playing.*

- FPS Increase

*We always love more FPS, and this is what you'll get. We've increased the FPS cap to 120.*

- DFJK Support

*As standard 4k practice, the default keybinds for many rhythm games are DFJK. We've allowed you to swap from WASD to DFJK in the options menu now.*

- Replays

*Ever wanted to show your friend a crazy score? Well, the replay system lets you do that without recording videos!*

**please note the replay system is in beta, and is not 100% accurate YET*

- Offset

*Do your headphones have an audio delay? Well, you can set a note offset in the options menu!*

- Latest FNF Github Features

*Have you ever seen a feature shown in the GitHub repo, and you don't know how to build the game? Well, features from there get ported into here, and then we can add them into this mod and build it for you!*

**HUGE NOTICE**

This is a **MOD**. This is not Vanilla and should be treated as a **MODIFICATION**. This will probably never be official, so don't get confused.
